# Dotfiles

I have attempted to create the best possible Mouseless Development Environment for myself. Most (non-Linux-specific) dotfiles are also compatible with Mac based on my testing[^1], though some integrations may require additional setup.

My Dotfiles are managed with [ Chezmoi ](https://chezmoi.io)

I am currently in love with [Folke's Tokyo Night Color Scheme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), so most of my configurations, when applicable, will include a Tokyo Night theme.

## What's Included:

- Almost fully mouseless [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) configuration and theming
- [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) configuration and theming
- Fully custom [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) environment utilizing [Antidote](https://antidote.sh/), [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt, zsh-completions, zsh-autosuggestions, fast-syntax-highlighting, zsh-history-substring-search, and custom scripts
- [Nvim](https://neovim.io/] config utilizing [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/) with a significant amount of personal tweaks and plugins
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) configurations utilizing [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) and various Tmux plugins. Custom mappings and leader keys
- Basic [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) configuration and theming
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) launcher customizations and theming
- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) theming
- Catnip configuration and theming
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) temp config (was buggy so I switched back to Tmux, but wanted to leave config in case I try it again)
- Other miscellaneous configurations and tweaks
