# Dotflies

I have attempted to make the best possible Mouseless Development Environment that I can for myself. Most dotfiles are also compatibile with Mac from my testing, but the intigration could be different.

My Dotfiles are managed with [ Chezmoi ](https://chezmoi.io)

I am currently in love with [Folke's Tokyo Night Color Scheme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), so most of my configurations, when applicable, will include a Tokyo Night theme.

## What's Included?

- Almost fully mouseless Hyprland configuration and themeing
- Waybar configuration and themeing
- Fully custom ZSH environment utilizing antidote, pure prompt, zsh-completions, zsh-autosuggestions, fast-syntax-highlighting, zsh-history-substring-search, and custom scripts.
- Nvim config utilizing NVChad with a significant amount of personal tweaks and plugins
- Tmux configurations utilizing TPM and various Tmux plugins. Custom mappings and leader keys.
- Basic Wezterm configuration and themeing
- Rofi launcher customizations and themeing
- Bat themeing
- Catnip configuration and themeing
- Zellij temp config (was buggy so I switched back to Tmux, but wanted to leave config in case I try it again)
- And some other small stuff

## NOTICE / WARNING

**Should you choose to take inspiration from my Dotfiles, feel free, but I am not liable for anything not working on your system the same way that it works on mine.**
