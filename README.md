# Dotflies

I have attempted to create the best possible Mouseless Development Environment for myself. Most (non-Linux-specific) dotfiles are also compatible with Mac based on my testing[^1], though integration may vary.

My Dotfiles are managed with [ Chezmoi ](https://chezmoi.io)

I am currently in love with [Folke's Tokyo Night Color Scheme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), so most of my configurations, when applicable, will include a Tokyo Night theme.

## What's Included:

- Almost fully mouseless Hyprland configuration and theming
- Waybar configuration and theming
- Fully custom ZSH environment utilizing antidote, pure prompt, zsh-completions, zsh-autosuggestions, fast-syntax-highlighting, zsh-history-substring-search, and custom scripts
- Nvim config utilizing NVChad with a significant amount of personal tweaks and plugins
- Tmux configurations utilizing TPM and various Tmux plugins. Custom mappings and leader keys
- Basic Wezterm configuration and theming
- Rofi launcher customizations and theming
- Bat theming
- Catnip configuration and theming
- Zellij temp config (was buggy so I switched back to Tmux, but wanted to leave config in case I try it again)
- Other miscellaneous configurations and tweaks

## NOTICE / WARNING:

**Feel free to take inspiration from my Dotfiles, but I am not liable if they do not work on your system as they do on mine.**
